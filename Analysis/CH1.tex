    \section{Algebraic and Order properties}
    The Real numbers, denoted $\R$ form a field, that is $\R$ is an Abelian group under addition and multiplication that 
    has distinct identites and satisfies the distributive property. All important algebraic properties can be derivied from the fact 
    that $\R$ is a field. 

    
    \begin{defn}
        Let $P \neq \varnothing$ be a subset of $\R$ not containg $0$. We say $P$ is the set of positive real numbers and it satisfies 
        
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item  $a, b \in  P \implies a + b \in P$
           \item $a,b \in P \implies ab \in P$ 
           \item $a \in P \implies a \in P \vee -a \in P \vee  a = 0$
            
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{defn}

    We are now in a posistion to define the ordering we wish to place on $\R$ 

    
    \begin{defn}
        For $a, b \in \R$ such that $b - a \in P$ then we say $a < b$. 
        If $b -a \in P \cup \{0\}$ then $a \leq b$
    \end{defn}

    It follows imeditly from tricotomy that exactly one of $a < b, a = b, a > b$ must hold. 
    It is also clear that this is a total ordering on $\R$, but we must check that this turns $\R$ into an ordered field. 

    
    \begin{lem}
        The ordering defined above is a strict total order. 
    \end{lem}

    
    \begin{proof}
        The order is irreflexive since $a-a = 0 \notin P$, then if $a - b \in P$ and $b - a \in P$ we can add to get 
        $0 \in P$ a contradiction. Now we must prove the transitive property, suppose $a, b, b \in \R$ satisfy 
        $a < b $ and $b < c$, then $b - a, c - b \in P$ thus so is their sum, $c - a \in P$ which implies $a < c$ as desired. 
    \end{proof}

    
    \begin{lem}
        The ordering defined above turns $\R$ into an ordered field, let $a, b, c \in \R$.
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item if $a < b$ then $a + c < a + b$
            \item if $c > 0 $ and $a < b$ then $ac < bc$
            \item if $c < 0$ and $ a < b$ then $ac > bc$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{lem}

    
    \begin{proof}
        For the first item, we have $b - a > 0$ then by adding and subtracting $c$ we get 
        \[ 0 < b - a - c + c \] 
        \[a + c < b + c\]
        Next assume $c > 0$, then we have $0 < b - a$, since both of theses are positive, so is their product, 
        \[0 < c(b - a) \implies  0 < cb - ca \implies ca < cb.\]
        Now let $c < 0$, then $-c >0$ and the argument is the same as above.  
    \end{proof}

    Thus we have turned $\R$ into an ordered field. 

    
    \begin{thm}
        The natural numbers are all positive, we will prove this in the following steps. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $a \in \R$ with $a \neq 0$ then $a^2 > 0$
            \item $1 > 0$
            \item $\N \subset P$ 
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        If $a > 0$ we are done, suppose $a < 0$, then $-a \in P$ and since 
        $a^2 = (-a)(-a) \in P$ we have $a^2 \in P$. Now note $1^2 = 1$ so $1 \in P$, 
        then since we definied the natural number $n$ as $1 + \cdots + 1, n$ times, 
        we see that all natural numbers are positive. 
    \end{proof}

    
    \begin{thm}
        If $a \in \R$ satisfies $0 \leq a < \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon > 0$, then $a = 0$
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $a > 0$, then let $\epsilon_0 = a/2$, then 
        \[0 < \epsilon_0 < a < \epsilon\]
        a contradiction.
    \end{proof}

    
    \begin{thm}
        If $ab > 0$ then $a, b$ are both posistive or both negitive. 

    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $ab > 0$ and that at least one is negative, without loss of generality say $a < 0$, then if $b > 0$, we have 
        $-ab > 0$ so $-(ab) \in P$ but we assumed $ab \in P$; a contradiction, thus $b$ is negitive. 
    \end{proof}

    \section{Absoulte Value}
    Next we define a function of great importance on $\R$. 

    
    \begin{equation}
        |a| \, = \, 
        \left\{
        \begin{array}{lr}
             a, & \textit{if }  a > 0 \\ 
             0, & \textit{if } a = 0 \\ 
            -a, & \textit{if } a < 0 
        \end{array}
        \right\}
    \end{equation}

    Now we prove some basic properties of the absoulte value function, 

    
    \begin{thm}
        Basic properties of the absoutle value. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $|ab| = |a||b|$
            \item $|a|^2 = a^2 $
            \item If $c  > 0$ then $|a| \leq c \Leftrightarrow -c \leq a \leq c$
            \item $-|a| \leq a \leq |a|$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        To prove $(1)$ first note that if $a$ or $b$ is zero we are done. Then we just consider the four possible cases on the signs of $a$ and $b$. For example if $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, 
        we have $|ab| = -ab$ and $|a| = a, |b| = -b$ so $|a||b| = -ab$. The rest are left as an exercise. 
        Proving $(2)$ is simillar, if $a > 0$ we are done and if $a < 0$, then $|a|^2 = (-a)^2 = a^2$. 
        Now suppose $c > 0$ and $|a| \leq c$, if $a \leq 0$, then the result is clear. If $a < 0$ we have $|a| = -a$, so 
        $-a < c$, rearranging gives $-c < a$. So we are finished. Now suppose $-c \leq a \leq c$, then $-a \leq c$ and $a \leq c$. But the absoute value maps to 
        $a$ or $-a$ so in either case we are done. 
        Now for $(4)$ we let $c = |a|$ and apply $(3)$ to get the result. 
    \end{proof}

    
    \begin{thm}[Triangle Inequality]
        For all $a, b \in \R$ 
        
        \begin{equation}
            |a + b| \, \leq \, |a| + |b|
        \end{equation}
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        By the above, we have that
        \[-|a| -|b| \leq a + b \leq |a| + |b| \] 
        implies 
        \[|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\]
        as desired. 
    \end{proof}

    The Triangle inequality is very important and equality hold only when $a, b$ have the same sign. 

    
    
    \begin{thm}
        The following two inequalitys hold for all $a, b \in \R$
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $|a - b| \leq |a| + |b|$
            \item $||a| -|b|| \leq |a - b|$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        Proof of $(1)$ follows from subing $-b$ into the triangle inequality. 
        To prove $(2)$ start my applying the triangle inequality to $a = a - b + b$ to get 
        $|a| \leq |a - b| + |b| $, and $b = b - a + a$ to get $|b| \leq |b-a| + |a|$,
        then subtracting gives 
        \[|a| - |b| \leq |a - b| \] 
        and 
        \[|b| - |a| \leq |a - b|.\]
        We may multiply by $-1$ to get 
        \[-|b| + |a| \geq -|a-b|\] 
        and it follows, 
        \[-|a-b| \leq |a| - |b| \leq |a - b|.\]
        Now we let $|a - b| = c$ and use the third result from theorem 1.2.1, to get 
        \[|a|- |b| \leq |a - b|\]

    \end{proof}


    \section{Archimeadian Property and Completness} 

    The completness axiom is the last thing that we need in order to call are a complete ordered field. 


    
    \begin{defn}
        A subset $A \subset \R$ is bounded is above if there exists $u \in \R$ such that for all $a \in A$ we have 
        $a \leq u$, we say $A$ is bounded below if the other inequality holds. We call $u$ an upper bound or lower bound 
        for the set $A$. 
    \end{defn}

    We say a set is bounded if it is bounded above and below. 

    
    \begin{defn}
        We say that an upper bound $\alpha \in \R$ is a least upper bound if 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\alpha $ is an upper bound. 
            \item For an arbitrary upper bound $u$, we have $\alpha \leq u$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{defn}

    
    \begin{defn}
        Every subset $A \subset \R$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound. 
    \end{defn}

    We will see that this property is very important. 

    
    
    \begin{thm}
        Let $A \subset \R$, an upper bound $\alpha \in \R$ satisfies $\alpha = \sup(A)$ if and only if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $a \in A$ such that $\alpha - \epsilon < a$
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\alpha = \sup(A)$ then for all $\epsilon > 0$, $\alpha - \epsilon < \alpha$ so it cannot be an upper bound. Conversly, let $\alpha $ be an upper bound with the desired property 
        and let $u$ be an upper bound, then if $u < \alpha$ we have $u = \alpha - \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, but then by assumtion there is an $a \in A$ such that $u < a$; 
        a contradiction. 
    \end{proof}


    \begin{lem}
        $\N$ is not bounded above in $\R$
    \end{lem}

    
    \begin{proof}
        Assume that $\N$ is bounded, then there exists a least upper bound, let $\alpha = \sup(A)$, then there exists $n \in \N$ such that $\alpha - 1 < n$, but then 
        $\alpha < n + 1$; a contradiction. 
    \end{proof}

    
    \begin{thm}
        For all $\epsilon \in \R_{>0}$ there exists $n \in \N$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \epsilon$.
    \end{thm}

    
    \begin{proof}
        By the unboundedness of $n$, we may choose $n \in \N$ such that $\frac{1}{e} < n$, then $\frac{1}{n} < \epsilon$. 
    \end{proof}
