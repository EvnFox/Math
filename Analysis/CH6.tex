\begin{chapter}{Fuctions of Bounded Variation}

We discuss functions of bounded variation. 

\begin{thm}
    Let $f:[a, b] \to \R$ be increasing and let $P$ be a partition.  Then 
    \[ \sum_{k = 1}^n f(x_k+)-f(x_k-) \leq f(b) - f(a) \]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    For each $k = 1, \dots n$ let $y_k \in (x_k, x_x+1)$. We have the following two inequalities 

\end{proof}
