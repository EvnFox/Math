\begin{chapter}{Sequences}
    We have spent about the first 7-8 weeks of the course discussing the basic propertys of metric spaces and well as learning some topology. Now we get to what is more generally considered analysis, 
    which begins with a rigorous study of sequences. 

	A sequence can be thought of as a function $x: \N \to \R$, we often write $x_n $ for $x(n)$ 


	Here are more additions $\xi$.
