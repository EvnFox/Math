    \questionpart
    We want to test the hypothesis that girls read more than boys so our $H_a$ is $\mu_g > \mu_b$. Our 
    Null hypothesis will be that this is not the case so $H_0$ is $\mu_g \leq \mu_b$. 
    \questionpart 
    If we repeated the same study many times, and $H_0$ is true, then about $7\%$
    of the studies would provide as much or more evidence for $H_a$.

\question
I got 0.0083 which means there is a 0.83\% chance of getting 3 heads on th biased coins. This makes since becuase the probability of any one coin being heads is .2 and 
or 20\% and so the probability of all 3 being heads should be unlikely. We have $.2^3 = .008$ as the theoretical and our approxamation is very close.
