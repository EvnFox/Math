            Prove that the $\sqrt{3} \notin \Q$
            
            First, I prove that $3|x^2 \implies 3|x$ as I will need this fact in my proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt{3}$. 
            
            \begin{proof}
                We use the contrapositive, so assume that $3\nmid x$. Then there exists $k \in \Z$ such that $x = 3k + 1$ or $ x = 3k + 2$. Then note that if $x = 3k + 1$, then 
                \[ x = 3k + 1 \] 
                \[ x^2 = 9k^2 + 6k + 1 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1\]
                
                and in the other case we have
                
                \[ x = 3k + 2 \] 
                \[ x^2 = 9k^2 + 12k + 4 = 3(3k^2 + 4k + 1) + 1 \] 
                
                So, in both cases we see that $3\nmid x^2$ as desired. 
            \end{proof}
            
            Now I prove that $\sqrt{3} \notin \Q$ 
            \begin{proof}
                For the sake of contradiction, assume that $\sqrt{3} \in \Q$. Then we may fix $m, n \in \Q$ such that $\sqrt{3} = \frac{m}{n}$. We then have that, 
                
                \[ 3 = \left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^2 \]\ 
                
                by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may write $m^2$ and $n^2$ in terms of their prime factors and cancel any factor(s) that they have in common, i.e., we reduce $\frac{m}{n}$ such that they have no common factors. Since $m$ and $n$ have no common factors we note that they cannot both be divisible by 3. Fist observe that 
                \begin{equation}
                    3n^2 = m^2
                \end{equation}
                
                
                and hence we have $3| m^2$ which implies $3|m$; so we fix $k \in \Z$ such that $ m = 3k$ and then we substitute this expression for $m$ back into (1). 
                
                \begin{equation}
                     3n^2 = (3k)^2 = 9k^2
                \end{equation}
                
                \begin{equation}
                     n^2 = 3k^2 
                \end{equation}
                
                and we have that 3 divides $n^2$ and by extension 3 divides $n$. Thus we have a contradiction as desired.  
            \end{proof}
        \questionpart
            Does a similar argument work to prove that $\sqrt{6} \notin \Q$? Where does the proof breakdown for $\sqrt{4}$?
            
                Yes, weather or not this method works for $\sqrt{x}$ is related to the prime factorization of $x$, since the prime factors of 6 both have an exponent of 1, $6|m^2 \implies 6|m$ will hold. This is because if 2 and 3 are prime factors of $m^2$ then they will have to be prime factors of m, otherwise how would they have been prime factors of $m^2$? The point is squaring a number doesn't add new prime factors; it just multiples the exponent of each prime factor by 2. When we try to apply this argument to $\sqrt{4}$ the problem is that $4|m^2 \implies 4|m$ doesn't hold since the exponent of the prime factor of 4 is 2. To give an example note that $4|36 = 6^2 = 2^23^2$ but $4\nmid 6 = 3 (2) $.

    \question
    Prove that there is no rational number satisfying $2^r = 3$. 
    
    \begin{proof}
    We use contradiction, so assume that there exists $r \in \Q$ such that $2^r = 3$. Then since $r$ is rational by assumption we may fix $m, n \in \Q$ such that $r = \frac{m}{n}$. Substituting in for $r$ gives
    
    \[ 2^{\frac{m}{n} = 3} \] 
    
    then we raise both sides to the $n^{\text{th}}$ power and get 
    
    \[ 2^m = 3^n \] 
    
    which contradicts the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. 
    \end{proof}


\question
The triangle inequality is given by $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b| $.
    \begin{alphaparts}
        \questionpart
            Verify the triangle inequality in the special case that $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. 
            
            \begin{proof}
                Let $a,b \in \R$ and assume that $a $ and $b$ have the same sign. Then if $a$ and $b$ are both negitive we see that $|a + b| = a + b$ and if $a$ and $b$ are both positive then $|a + b| = a + b$. Then note that regardless of the signs of $a$ and $b$, $|a| + |b| = a + b$.
                It is then clear that the inequality holds. 
            \end{proof}
        \questionpart
            Give a general proof the the triangle inequality. 

            \begin{proof}
                First we prove that $(a + b)^2 \leq (|a| + |b|)^2 $ by observing $ab \leq |ab| $. Then we multiply both sides by $2$ and obtain $2ab \leq 2|ab|$, we then add $a^2 + b^2$ to both sides and get $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \leq |a|^2 + 2|ab| + |b|^2$. Factoring this gives 
                $(a + b)^2  \leq (|a| + |b|)^2$. We can now use this to prove the triangle inequality by taking the square root of both sides which yeilds, 

                \[
                    |a + b| \leq ||a| + |b|| 
                \]

                but since $|a| + |b| \geq 0$ we have 

                \[
                    |a + b| \leq |a| + |b|
                \]

                as desired. 
            
            \end{proof}

        \questionpart
            Use the triangle inequality to prove that $|a - b| \leq |a - c| + |c - d| + |d - b|$. 

            \begin{proof}
                Let $x = (a - c)$ and let $y = (c - d) + (d - b)$, the the triangle inequality tells us that 

                \[ |x + y| \leq |x| + |y| \] 
                \[ |a - b| \leq |a - c| + |(c - d) + (d - b)| \] 

                Now we can apply the triangle inequality again to the second term on the right hand side of the last 
                equation. So we let $z = (c - d)$ and let $w = (d - b)$, by the triangle inequality we the have $|c - b| \leq |c - d| + |d - b|$. 
                Substituting back in gives, 

                \[ |a - b| \leq |a - c| + |(c - d) + (d - b)| = |a - c| + |c - d| + |d - b| \] 
                \[|a - b| \leq |a - c| + |c - d| + |d - b|\]

                as desired. 

            \end{proof}

\question
Given a function $f$ and a subset of its domain $A$, let $f[A]$ denote the range of $f$ over $A$, i.e., $f[A] = \{f(x) | x \in A \} $

\begin{alphaparts}
    \questionpart
    let $f: \R \to \R$ given by $f(x) = x^2$. Let $A = [0, 2]$ and let $B = [1, 4]$. Does $f[A \cap B] = f[A] \cap f[B]$? What about $f[A \cup B] = f[A] \cup f[B]$? 

    
    \begin{proof}
        Both parts of this question are true. First I prove $f[A \cap B] = f[A] \cap f[B]$. First note that $A \cap B = [1, 2]$ then we may compute the range of $f$ on this domain and we get that $\ran f = [1, 4]$. 

       To prove that $\ran f = [1,4]$ first we prove that $\ran f \subseteq [1, 4]$ so let $y \in \ran f$. Then we fix $x \in \dom f$ such that $y = f(x) = x^2$. Then since $f$ is increasing on the interval $[1,2]$ it is clear that $y \in [1, 4]$. 
       Now to prove that $[1,4] \subseteq \ran f$ let $y \in [1, 4]$ be arbitrary. Then we must find a $x \in \dom f$ such that $f(x) = y$. Choosing $x = \sqrt{y}$ gives the desired result. Since $f(\sqrt{y}) = (\sqrt{y})^2 = y$. Since $\sqrt{y}$ is well defined on $[0, 4]$ 
       we conclude that $\ran f = [1, 4]$. Hence $f[A \cap B] = [1, 4]$. 
    \end{proof}

    \questionpart 
    Give an example where $f[A \cap B] = f[A] \cap f[B]$ doesn't hold. 

    Example: let $A = [-1, -2]$ and $B = [1, 2]$. 

    \questionpart 
    Let $A,B \subseteq \R$ and prove that for an arbitrary function $g: \R \to \R$, $g[A \cap B] \subseteq g[A] \cap g[B]$.

    \begin{proof}
        Let $y \in g[A \cap B]$ be arbitrary. Then there exists an $x \in A \cap B$ such that $y = g(x)$. Since $x \in A \cap B$ we know that $x \in A$ and $x \in B$. We also have that $y = g(x)$. 
        Hence $y \in g[A] $ and $y \in g[B]$. Then we have that $y \in g[A] \cap g[B]$.  
    \end{proof}

    *side note: if I add the condidtion that $g$ be injective, I think that you could prove $g[A \cap B] = g[A] \cap g[B]$. 
    A counter example existed for $f(x) = x^2$ only because it is not injective (I think). 

    \questionpart 
    Form a conjecture about $g[A \cup B]$ and $g[A] \cup g[B]$ and prove it. 

    Conjecture: $g[A \cup B] = g[A] \cup g[B]$. 

    \begin{proof}
        Let $y \in g[A \cup B]$ then we may fix $x \in A \cup B$ such that $y = g(x)$. Since we have that $x \in A$ or $x \in B$, we know that either $y \in g[A] $ or $y \in [B]$. It is then clear that $y$ is in the union. 
        To prove the other direction assume that $y \in g[A] \cup g[B]$, then either $y \in g[A] $ or $y \in g[B]$. If $y \in g[A]$ then we may fix $x \in A$ such that $y = g(x)$. Then it follows that $x \in A \cup B$; So then $y \in g[A \cup B]$. If it is not the case 
        that $y \in g[A]$ then $y \in g[B]$ must be true and the argument is the same. 
    \end{proof}
