\question
Let $|G| = pq$ for primes $p,q$. Show that all proper subgroups of $G$ are cyclic. Must $G$ be 
cyclic? 

\begin{proof}
    Let $H \leq G$ be a proper subgroup so $|H| \neq |G|$. Then by Lagrange's theorem we have $|H| \mid |G|$, then the possible orders 
    for $H$ are $1, p,$ and $q$. Note the trivial subgroup is generated by the identity. Then if $H$ has prime order $p$ each non-identity 
    element must also have order $p$ since the order of any element in a group must devide the order of the group and the 
    only divisor of $p$ greater than one is $p$ itself, and so, it follows every element must generate $H$. 
    The same argument clearly works if $H$ has order $q$ since all we needed was that $p$ was prime.
    
    $G$ need not be cyclic: consider $S_3$. 
    
\end{proof}

\question
Let $G$ be an abelian group of odd order. Show that the product of all elements in $G$ is equal to the identity. 

\begin{proof}
    Note that since $G$ has odd order, no element can have order two since the order of an element must devide the order of the group. 
    So then every element in $G$ has a distinct inverse. Then since $G$ is abelian we may rearange the product how we like and get 
    \[\Pi G = (g_1 \times g_1^{ - 1}) \times (g_2 \times g_2^{ - 1}) \dots  = e \times e \times \dots = e\]
    This completes the proof. 
\end{proof}
